# Servington - The premiere app for community service!



## Background

This app was created for a Software Development Practices class at Iowa State University. I took this class my sophomore year. I was in a group with three other people, and was one of two frontend developers.

Frontend - Connor Ferris (me), Mike Wailes

Backend - Logan McDermott, Kolby Kucera

Our project was hosted on Gitlab through a school server. I had never used Git until this class, but I am very competent with it now.

We used Android Studio for the frontend of our app. I really enjoyed working with this IDE and was able to be creative and effective with different views and activities.

We had frontend/backend "talking" with HTTP requests. At the later end of the project, we also were able to introduce a websocket as well.

## Concept

I am proud to say that the base concept of this app was my idea initially! 

Servington is an app where Organizations hosting community service events and Volunteers can be linked to each other.

You can register as an Organization or a Volunteer. Organizations can post community service opportunities, whereas Volunteers can sign up for them. Think of this as LinkedIn but instead of jobs, community service events.

We didn't feel a concept similar to this currently existed. It would be something new and fresh to work on. We had the whole semester to work on this project, and I can say we were all very passionate about it to the end of the class.

## My (Connor's) Contributions

Key Features I implemented on the Frontend:

- Account creation of all two types of user: Volunteer and Organization

- Handling various activities associated with each user type by encapsulation in fragments/bottom navigation bar (stops app from having ugly transitions from one activity to the next)

- Logging into app with password verification

- Loading user data into Singleton class/updating user data on Backend

- Ability for user to change their data (display name, email, password, etc.)

- Volunteer global chat via websocket

- Special account type: Admin

- Creation of Admin accounts through one master Admin (intended for usage by developers/employees only), can also view all current admin accounts on server

- Ability for Admin to ban/unban accounts

- Ability for Admin to recieve reports made by Organizations/Volunteers. Reports would include the name of an account or post made and a description of why it was reported

## Takeaways

I really enjoyed this class and working on Servington. I really liked the creativity I had on Frontend, I found a lot of tutorials online pertianing to different views that were possible to implement into Android, and put my own twist on them. The goal of this class is to work with a team and use key software development processes (AGILE, SCRUM, along with using Git to keep each other on the same page), but there was something really fun about being able to go out and learn new things on my own, and share them with my team.

I learned a lot about software development and its process in this class, while also expanding my current set of programming skills. If I had a goal for the next time I were to do this again, I think I would like to try and learn the Backend side of things.
